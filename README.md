# 💤 LazyVim

This is a basic LazyVim setup that has been optimised primarily for use as a Python dev environment.

## Quarto

To use Quarto to work in notebooks and produce neat reports, set up Poetry and add the following packages:

* `poetry add nbformat`
* `poetry add jupyter`

TODO: The Code Diagnostic doesn't work very well in Quarto.
